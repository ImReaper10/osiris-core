# Team 6: Client SDK Advanced Features

## Below is a list of the technology we plan to use:
We’ll be working with Python to complete our tasks, and for handling gRPC, we’ll be using the grpcio library. This should cover what we need for now, but as we move forward, we might bring in more Python libraries or other tools if necessary.

## List of assigments for members of the team:

### Japjot Bedi
- API 3: Real-time Monitoring Command 
- API 8: Aggregate Function Results Command 

### Javin Kenta
- API 5: Function Call with Circuit Breaker Command

### Oscar Cotto
- API 2 : Function Retry Command 
- API 6: Cache Function Results Command 

### Diego Velasquez
- API 4: Stream Function Output Command 
### Husain Awan
- API 7: Invalidate Cache Command
- Write the function to invalidate a cached result based on function name and arguments. Handle cases where the cache entry doesn’t exist.
- Build a simple in-memory cache to simulate real behavior, allowing validation of cache invalidation.
- Write unit tests to ensure cache entries are properly invalidated and handle non-existing entries.
- Start creating reusable error-handling functions to standardize error management across APIs.
 

### James Goode
- API 1: Batch Function Calls Command
- API 9: Parallel Function Execution Command
- Setting up the shared file in the parent folder with Team 5 ("The Outsiders")
